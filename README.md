# OdeToFood2

This demo is from coursework - I will be adding more features to turn it into a blog. 
Currently it is just a simple razor app. If you go to:

[/Restaurants/ClientApp](/Restaurants/ClientApp)

you will find a Web API Client using JQuery that displays the tables from a Controller in the app

I will be working on a new Bootstrap front-end maybe with Angular, then I will be refactoring it
to use a different architecture and add testing and deployment
